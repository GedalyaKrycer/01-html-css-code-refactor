# 02-Homework 

## Summary 
In this project I reviewed an HTML and CSS files, looking for oppurtinies to improve the code for accessibility and semantic best practices. 

### Items That Were Updated

1. Made the `<title>` element more descriptive

2. Changed the `<div>` with the `.header` class into a `<header>` html element 

3. Changed the `<div>` inside the `<header>` to a `<nav>`

4. Added in inline comments to both HTML and CSS for future devs 

5. Restructured some of CSS, so they were listed in more logical groups. Such as putting the regular `p` and `a` selectors in the **Global** group. 

6. Changed the content `<div>` to `<main>` since it holds the primary content of the page. 

7. Changed the "benefits" `<div>` to an `<aside>` since it indirectly relates to the main content.  

8. Added descriptive alt attributes to all of the `<img>` elements. 

9. Removed the not needed closing tag for the `<img>` element within Cost Management.

10. Replaced the `<div>` elements within the main Service sections with `<section>` elements. 

11. Moved the `.hero` class into a span element and gave it an `aria-label=""` and `role=""` so it could be read by screen readers. 

12. Changed the `.footer` class and `<div>` to a `<footer>` element and the corresponding CSS selector.

13. Updated the copyright in the footer to be for 2020.
